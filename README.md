# javartm library README

The javartm library allows Java/JVM users to use the "Restricted Transactional Memory" support available on some Intel CPUs. See [here][inteltsx] for more details.

In practice, this allows code running on the JVM to enjoy the benefits of Hardware Transactional Memory.

javartm is distributed under the terms of the GNU LGPLv3; see the COPYING and COPYING.LESSER files for more details.

## Hardware Requirements

As of this writing only CPUs based on the Intel Haswell architecture include the necessary hardware for RTM. See [here][inteltsx] for Intel's announcement, and [here][tsxspecs] for the specifications.

Testing on other CPUs can be done using the [Intel Software Development Emulator][intelsde].

## Building

Building is done with ant.
Gcc's native suport for RTM (for versions >= 4.8) is used if available; otherwise javartm includes a fallback alternative.

# Download

Prebuilt packages can be found at [http://ivoanjo.github.io/javartm/bin-releases/][packages].

## Testing with Intel SDE

The script `scripts/runpin.sh` can be used to run applications with javartm using the Intel SDE, which is supported on all x86-64 CPUs.

## Who am I

My name is [Ivo Anjo][insthome] and I am a PhD student working on Software Transactional Memory and Speculative Parallelization at the [Software Engineering Group][eswweb] (ESW) at INESC-ID Lisboa.

Feel free to contact me about javartm at <ivo.anjo@ist.utl.pt>.

Some other software I am involved with and that might interest you is the [Java Versioned Software Transactional Memory (JVSTM)][jvstm], a Java library implementing TM and the [FÃ©nix Framework][fenixf], a framework for building web-applications combining transactional memory and persistence.

Thanks for reading this far! :)
