# javartm library README

The javartm library allows Java/JVM users to use the "Restricted Transactional Memory" support available on some Intel CPUs. See [here][inteltsx] for more details.

In practice, this allows code running on the JVM to enjoy the benefits of Hardware Transactional Memory.

javartm is distributed under the terms of the GNU LGPLv3; see the COPYING and COPYING.LESSER files for more details.

## Hardware Requirements

As of this writing only CPUs based on the Intel Haswell architecture include the necessary hardware for RTM. See [here][inteltsx] for Intel's announcement, and [here][tsxspecs] for the specifications.

Testing on other CPUs can be done using the [Intel Software Development Emulator][intelsde].

## Building

Building is done with ant, and requires the [ant-cpptasks][ant-cpptasks] library.

Note that the `ant-contrib-cpptasks` package in Ubuntu is not installed to the right place, and ant will not be able to use it automatically. (To fix it, run `sudo ln -sf /usr/share/java/ant-contrib-cpptasks.jar /usr/share/ant/lib/.`)

There are two alternatives for building:
* ant's default targets need gcc >= 4.8, as this is the first version that has built-in support for RTM instructions.
* The oldgcc-* targets provide a fallback option for other compilers. See `ant -projecthelp` for more details.

I plan on providing binary packages of javartm soon. If they aren't up yet, feel free to mail me to ask for them.

## Testing with Intel SDE

The script `scripts/runtest.sh` runs a very simple test of javartm using the Intel SDE.

## Who am I

My name is [Ivo Anjo][insthome] and I am a PhD student working on Software Transactional Memory and Speculative Parallelization at the [Software Engineering Group][eswweb] (ESW) at INESC-ID Lisboa.

Feel free to contact me about javartm at <ivo.anjo@ist.utl.pt>.

Some other software I am involved with and that might interest you is the [Java Versioned Software Transactional Memory (JVSTM)][jvstm], a Java library implementing TM and the [FÃ©nix Framework][fenixf], a framework for building web-applications combining transactional memory and persistence.

Thanks for reading this far! :)
